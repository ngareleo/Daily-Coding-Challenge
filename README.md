# Daily-Coding-Challenge

This is my attempt of the Daily coding challenge. I will update with solved problems.

The `problems` module contains solutions implemented while `Tests` module contains unit tests for the problems.

_Some tests are small, feel free to add more test cases through a PR_

To execute all tests,

`py -m unittest discover -s tests -v`
